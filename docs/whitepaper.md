# ZOKA

## Privacy by Default Blockchain — Version 1.0

**Status:** Mainnet v0.1.0 — public, permissionless, mining open.

---

## Abstract

ZOKA is a privacy-first blockchain that hides sender, recipient and amount of every value-bearing
transaction by construction. There is no transparent mode, no opt-in shield: the protocol refuses
to broadcast economic data in cleartext.

The implementation combines five well-understood cryptographic primitives:

1. **Groth16 zk-SNARKs** over BLS12-381 for transaction validity proofs.
2. **Pedersen commitments** over Ristretto255 for confidential amounts.
3. **Bulletproof range proofs** to prevent inflation under hidden amounts.
4. **CLSAG ring signatures** to hide the sender inside a candidate ring.
5. **Stealth addresses** with separated scan and spend keys so the same recipient never
   appears twice on chain.

Consensus is **RandomX-compatible Proof of Work** (`zoka-randomx-v1`). Block production is
permissionless, CPU-friendly, and ASIC-resistant. The native token is **ZKA**, capped at
23,000,000 units, with no premine and no foundation allocation.

This document describes the protocol that the v0.1.0 mainnet implementation actually ships.
Aspirational features are marked **Planned** and not claimed as live.

## 1. Scope and Status

This whitepaper describes Version 1.0 of the ZOKA protocol as implemented in the public
reference codebase at [github.com/ZokaNetwork/ZokaNetwork](https://github.com/ZokaNetwork/ZokaNetwork).

**Live in mainnet v0.1.0:**

- Privacy-by-default private transactions (ring sigs + stealth + Pedersen + Bulletproofs + Groth16).
- RandomX-compatible Proof of Work consensus.
- libp2p peer-to-peer transport with gossipsub.
- Public bootstrap node and signed mainnet manifest.
- Open-source `zoka` CLI and `zokahd` daemon.
- Cross-platform desktop wallet (ZSilent Core, Windows and Linux).

**Planned, not yet shipped:**

- External cryptographic audit. The code has been reviewed internally; an independent audit
  is required before this document can be treated as a formally verified specification.
- Tor / I2P anonymous transport. The mainnet manifest already declares the policy, but the
  runtime currently uses clear TCP.
- macOS and mobile clients.
- Multi-party computation (MPC) ceremony for a fresh trusted setup. The current Groth16
  parameters in `trusted-setup/` ship with a DIGEST file so that every node can verify the
  hash matches the network-expected value; a public MPC remains future work.

No claim is made here that the planned milestones are already complete.

---

## 2. Threat Model

The protocol is designed to defend against:

1. A passive observer of the public chain, including any third party indexing block data.
2. A node operator who can read all gossiped traffic on the libp2p mesh.
3. An adversary who obtains the encrypted wallet file but does not have the wallet password.
4. A miner who attempts to censor or front-run transactions (MEV-style attacks).

The protocol does **not** defend against:

1. A global passive adversary observing both ends of every network link in real time.
2. Post-quantum adversaries. BLS12-381 and the discrete-log assumptions underpinning ring
   signatures and stealth addresses are not post-quantum safe today. Past privacy survives a
   future quantum break; new transactions issued after such a break would not.
3. A user who reuses zpriv addresses across distinct off-chain identities.
4. A user with a compromised spending key. There is no recovery backdoor.
5. Local disk compromise combined with knowledge of the wallet password.

## 3. Cryptographic Stack

### 3.1 Curves and Domains

| Curve         | Use                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BLS12-381     | SNARK proving and verification.                                              |
| Ristretto255  | Ring signatures, Pedersen commitments, stealth keys, range proof commitments. |

### 3.2 Pedersen Commitments

For a value `v` and a blinding factor `r`:

```
C(v, r) = v*G + r*H
```

with independent generators `G` and `H` over Ristretto255. Properties:

- Perfectly hiding.
- Computationally binding.
- Additively homomorphic, so `C(v1) + C(v2) = C(v1 + v2)`.

### 3.3 Confidential Balance Equation

Every private transaction satisfies:

```
sum(C_in) = sum(C_out) + C_fee + X*H
```

where `C_fee = fee*G + r_fee*H` and `X = sum(r_in) - sum(r_out) - r_fee`. Validation fails if
this equation does not hold over the curve group, which guarantees inputs equal outputs without
the network ever seeing a cleartext amount.

### 3.4 Range Proofs

Each committed amount is constrained to:

```
0 <= v < 2^32
```

via Bulletproof verification. This prevents overflow-based inflation while keeping the value
encrypted. Typical proof size is roughly 600 bytes.

### 3.5 Nullifiers

Each consumed note yields a single-use nullifier:

```
N = H(s || idx || nonce)
```

The network maintains a set of seen nullifiers and rejects any transaction whose inputs would
re-emit one. Double-spend prevention is therefore enforced without any link between the
nullifier and a specific output.

### 3.6 CLSAG Ring Signatures

For ring size `N`, the signature payload layout is:

```
sig = c0 || key_image || s0 || s1 || ... || s_(N-1)
```

Serialized size:

```
L_sig(N) = 32 * (N + 2) bytes
```

Verification is linear in `N`. The implementation lives at
`src/private_wallet/clsag.rs` and is exercised by the test vectors in
`src/private_wallet/clsag_vectors.json`.

### 3.7 Stealth Addresses

Recipients hold two key pairs: `(s, S=sG)` for scanning and `(b, B=bG)` for spending. The
sender computes a one-time output public key:

```
P = H(r*S || idx)*G + B
```

where `r` is the sender's per-output randomness. The recipient scans the chain with `s` and
recognises outputs destined to them; only the holder of `b` can spend them. Reusing the
recipient identity does not produce repeated on-chain addresses.

---

## 4. Transaction and Validation Pipeline

A private transaction carries:

- Ring metadata: `ring_members`, `ring_signature`, `ring_version`.
- Input nullifiers and input commitments.
- Output commitments and range proofs.
- Fee commitment and fee range proof.
- Groth16 SNARK proof and Merkle root anchors.

Validation sequence (executed by every full node):

1. Structural and version checks.
2. Nullifier uniqueness against the current nullifier set.
3. Ring signature verification.
4. Range proof verification for every output and the fee.
5. Commitment balance equation over the group.
6. Inclusion proof check that ring members and notes exist in the chain.
7. Groth16 SNARK verification with the trusted-setup verifying key.

`ring_version = 1` is the active runtime path for private ring validation. Any transaction that
fails one of these checks is rejected at mempool time and never reaches the chain.

---

## 5. Consensus: RandomX Proof of Work

### 5.1 Algorithm

ZOKA uses a RandomX-compatible PoW algorithm identified by the network as `zoka-randomx-v1`.
RandomX is a CPU-friendly proof of work designed to be ASIC-resistant by executing random
programs over a large dataset that fits in CPU caches and DRAM.

### 5.2 Block Cadence

| Parameter                      | Value                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| Target block time              | 120 seconds          |
| Coinbase maturity              | 60 blocks            |
| Mining key rotation interval   | 2,048 blocks (~2.8 d)|
| Difficulty adjustment          | Per block, bounded   |

Finality is probabilistic. The protocol does not implement deterministic finality (PBFT or
similar). Applications requiring strong settlement should wait for several confirmations;
twelve is a conservative default.

### 5.3 Mining Participation

Mining is permissionless. Any operator can run the node with a private mining address:

```
zoka fullnode --network mainnet \
  --address zka1yourshieldedaddress... \
  --threads <N>
```

The mining reward is emitted as a private coinbase output. Observers see that a block was
mined; the chain never reveals how much the miner earned or which address received it.

### 5.4 No Validators, No Stake

There is no validator set, no proof of stake mechanism, and no economic finality. Mining
participation is bounded only by computational resources and electricity. The
`src/consensus/pbft.rs` module in the codebase is unused in the mainnet runtime and is retained
as scaffolding for future research; the mainnet runtime path is PoW only.

## 6. Token Economics — ZKA

| Parameter         | Value                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Symbol            | ZKA                                  |
| Decimals          | 6                                    |
| Smallest unit     | 1 atom = 10⁻⁶ ZKA                    |
| Max supply        | 23,000,000 ZKA = 23·10¹² atoms       |
| Genesis supply    | 0 ZKA                                |
| Initial reward    | 12 ZKA / block                       |
| Halving interval  | 1,051,200 blocks (~4 years)          |
| Tail emission     | None                                 |

Emission schedule:

| Era | Reward      | End block       | Cumulative supply |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0   | 12 ZKA      | 1,051,200       | ~12.6 M ZKA       |
| 1   | 6 ZKA       | 2,102,400       | ~18.9 M ZKA       |
| 2   | 3 ZKA       | 3,153,600       | ~22.0 M ZKA       |
| 3   | 1 ZKA       | exhausts cap    | 23 M ZKA          |

Emission stops at the 23 M cap. There is no premine, no founder allocation, no foundation
treasury. Every ZKA in circulation has been produced by a public block reward. Parameters are
verifiable in `src/economics.rs` and `docs/economics.testnet.v1.json` of the network repository.

## 7. Network Architecture

### 7.1 Peer-to-peer Transport

Nodes communicate over libp2p. The protocol stack:

- TCP listener for inbound peer connections (default port 30303).
- Gossipsub for block and transaction propagation.
- Identify + ping for peer health.
- A protocol freeze identifier (`/zoka/1.0.0`) ensures peers refuse to interoperate across
  incompatible protocol versions.

The mainnet manifest at `docs/mainnet-network.v1.json` lists the public seed node, the
read-only RPC endpoint, and the transport policy. It is signed by the network operators and
shipped inside every binary release via `include_str!`.

### 7.2 Public Bootstrap

A read-only mainnet bootstrap node runs at:

```
fly-gru-bootstrap-1
/ip4/37.16.23.142/tcp/30303/p2p/12D3KooWDbdXAdGxVuSNLicfEf57qTzTRGviDXUbnGKAUV3yT2Xn
```

The node exposes a public, read-only HTTP RPC for chain status. It serves discovery and
initial sync. It does not hold user secrets, broadcast private keys, or arbitrate the chain.

### 7.3 Embedded Trusted Setup

The Groth16 proving and verifying parameters live in the network repository at
`trusted-setup/`. Files:

| File                  | Purpose                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `balance.params`      | Balance circuit parameters.       |
| `merkle.params`       | Merkle membership circuit.        |
| `nullifier.params`    | Nullifier circuit.                |
| `private_tx.params`   | Combined private-tx circuit.      |
| `DIGEST`              | SHA-256 of the parameter bundle.  |

Every node enforces that the local trusted-setup directory's digest matches the expected
network digest (`ZOKA_EXPECTED_SETUP_DIGEST`). A mismatch refuses to start the node. This
guards against an operator silently substituting a different CRS.

### 7.4 Binaries

The network repository builds two binaries:

| Binary    | Role                                                                          |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zoka`    | CLI for wallet ops, sync gating, mining control, full-node orchestration.     |
| `zokahd`  | Headless daemon variant intended for server / VPS deployment.                 |

Both binaries are bundled inside the ZSilent Core desktop wallet and supervised by it; the
desktop wallet is therefore not a separate client implementation but a UI over the same
canonical node software.

|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Block height and timestamp             | Required for consensus.                                                |

| Nullifiers                             | Required for double-spend prevention; not linkable to outputs.         |

| PoW difficulty, block size, gas-style budget metadata | Required for validation. |

## 9. Anonymity Functions

The following functions quantify privacy under stated assumptions.

### 9.1 Sender Anonymity

Let `N` be the ring size and `q ∈ (0,1]` the decoy quality factor (1 means ideal decoys
indistinguishable from the true spender). The effective ring size is:

```
N_eff = 1 + q * (N - 1)
```

The best posterior guess for the sender is:

```
P_sender = 1 / N_eff
```

The sender entropy in bits:

```
H_sender = log2(N_eff)
```

### 9.2 Network Source Exposure (Planned Tor/I2P)

Let `c` be the fraction of adversarial first-hop candidates and `h` the stem hop count for
Dandelion++ relay. The approximate stem compromise probability is:

```
P_stem_comp(c, h) = 1 - (1 - c)^h
```

The network anonymity score is:

```
A_net = 1 - P_stem_comp
```

This function describes the planned anonymous transport. Mainnet v0.1.0 uses cleartext TCP;
the value of `A_net` is therefore not currently bounded by this expression.

### 9.3 Timing Linkability

Let `b` be the effective batch cardinality observed by an external party. If the observer
cannot order the sender inside the batch:

```
P_time_link = 1 / b
H_time      = log2(b)
```

### 9.4 Composite Privacy Index

Define normalised components in `[0, 1]`:

```
S = H_sender / H_ref       # sender entropy normalised to a reference
T = H_time   / H_ref       # timing entropy normalised
A = A_net                  # network anonymity (1.0 when Tor/I2P is live)

PI = (S + T + A) / 3
```

`PI = 1.0` represents the strongest privacy state achievable by the protocol's combined
mechanisms. Mainnet v0.1.0 typically operates at `S = H_sender / H_ref` with `A` reduced
because Tor/I2P is still on the roadmap; users requiring maximum network anonymity should
operate the node behind their own Tor circuit until the runtime ships native support.

---

## 10. Honest Limits

These are limits of the design, not bugs to be fixed:

- A global passive adversary observing both ends of every link can correlate burst timing.
  Tor and I2P, once shipped, mitigate but do not eliminate this risk.
- The current cryptographic stack is not post-quantum. A future quantum break would not
  retroactively reveal already-issued transactions, but it would compromise new ones.
- A compromised spending key has no recovery backdoor. Custody is yours, with everything that
  implies. A lost seed is lost funds.
- Reusing zpriv addresses across distinct off-chain identities can leak associations between
  them.
- The network has no involuntary unmasking path. Only the user holding the key can reveal a
  transaction. This is the design; the cost is that there is no support team that can recover
  funds.
- Block time is 120 seconds. The first confirmation is not final; settlement systems should
  wait several blocks.
- The trusted setup parameters in v0.1.0 are bootstrap parameters with a single-operator
  origin. A multi-party MPC ceremony to produce successor parameters is on the roadmap and
  the protocol is built to allow CRS upgrades without changing the chain history.

Every released binary can be reproduced from the corresponding tagged source with the build
workflow at `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Each release ships SHA-256 checksums and the
trusted-setup DIGEST so an operator can verify, before running anything, that the local
parameters match the network-expected hash.

---

## 13. Closing Position

ZOKA is the protocol I built because I believe the right to transact in private is the last
frontier of individual freedom. It will not protect you from every threat; it does not promise
perfection. What it promises is the strongest privacy this implementation knows how to ship,
with the limits stated in plain text — not buried in a footnote.

Verify what is true. Reveal nothing else.
